# verbose-umbrella
a coding quiz homework assignment. The quiz is to display if the answers are correct or incorrect, and incorrect answers impact the timer. The remaining time at the end of the quiz becomes the score, and that is then saved locally as a viewable high score. 
The link to the application is https://razzlejazzled.github.io/verbose-umbrella/.
At this time, I'm having some issues and am not totally finished, so screenshots are not avaliable. Regardless, I have been instructed to submit what I have and will hopefully have the project finished soon.
